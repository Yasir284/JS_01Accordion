# JavaScript Accordion

- This is my first Javascript mini-Project. In this project I have made an FAQ section with JavasCript, in which you can see the answer of the FAQ's on clicking the '+' button.

- I have also added some animation to the button and the answer section

- It took me 3-4 hrs to make this project.
